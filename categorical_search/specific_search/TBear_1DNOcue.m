%   .m script to generate the fields for a txt conditions file for Tbear_traing
%   in monkeylogic. for this task, 
%   1) a category specific fixation point (blue:butterfly red:bear) appears
%   for wait_for_fix msec
%   2) subjects holds fixation for initial_fix msec
%   3) the target is presented in one of 4 random positions with a distractor 
%   randomly placed min one of the remaining 3 positions. 
%   the subject has max_reaction_time msec to complete a saccade to the
%   target. saccade_time msec are allowed for a saccade to be completed
%   4) the subject then holds fixation on the target for hold_target_time
%   msec
